# OPENAI_STT_TTS
It was always a small dream to create Ai assistant like JARVIS(sounds childish but It surely isn't easy)
here small step

I USED
1.OPENAI API for answering the questions
2.google speech recognition api to convert speech to text as open ai takes input prompt as a text
3.pyttsx3 to convert the generated Text output to Speech

IT WAS INDEED A VERY SIMPLE THING TO DO in 1st sem 
I'LL UPDATE THIS AS I GO AHEAD
